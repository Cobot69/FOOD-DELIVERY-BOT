## Identifying Client's Objectives:

The following table outlines the key objectives for the food delivery machine:

| SL NO. |                          Objectives                          |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Machine should handle short distance food deliveries       |
| 2      | Machine should use land or road based means of transport    |
| 3      | Machine should be semi-automatic                            |
| 4      | Machine should be able to deliver all types of food items possible |

### Design a semi automatic food delivery robot which can handle short distance food deliveries by using the means of road transport,should also be able to deliver all types of food items .
